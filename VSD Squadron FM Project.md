<details><summary><H6>RGBLEDEN</summary>

<p>This signal enables the RGB LED driver. It must be set to 1 for the driver to function.</p>



</details>

<details><summary><H6>RGB0PWM, RGB1PWM, RGB2PWM</H6></summary>

These signals control the ` PWM ` for the **red**, **green**, and **blue** channels, respectively. A value of 1 means the LED is on, while 0 means it is ` off `.



</details>

<details><summary><H6> Curren </H6> </summary>

<details><summary><H3>Summary of Part 1 </H3></summary>

<details><summary><H4>Purpose</H4></summary>

This Verilog module serves as an RGB LED controller, integrating an internal oscillator and a frequency counter to facilitate precise management of RGB LED outputs. By providing a stable internal clock source, the module ensures reliable timing for LED operations while incorporating a dedicated test signal for external monitoring. This design is particularly well-suited for embedded systems that require consistent LED performance with minimal reliance on external components.








</details>

<details><summary><H4>Internal Logic and Oscillator</summary>

At the heart of the module is a high-frequency oscillator (SB_HFOSC), which acts as the internal timing source. The output from this oscillator drives a 28-bit frequency counter that increments with each clock cycle. This counter not only tracks timing information but also outputs its 5th bit to the ` testwire ` , enabling external observation of the counter's state. This setup allows for effective monitoring and debugging of the module's timing behavior.




</details>

<details><summary><H4>RGB Led Driver Functionality</summary>


The RGB LED driver (SB_RGBA_DRV) is responsible for controlling the LED outputs with the following key features:

<details><summary><H5>Current-Controlled Outputs</H5></summary>

<p>Each color channel is configured with a minimum current setting of "0b000001," ensuring proper brightness levels.</p>


</details>

<details><summary><H5>PulseWidth Modulation(PWM)</H5></summary>

The driver utilizes PWM control for each color channel, allowing for dynamic adjustments in brightness and color mixing.


</details>

<details><summary><H5>Fixed Configuration</H5></summary>

- The blue LED is configured to operate at maximum brightness (RGB2PWM = 1'b1), providing a vibrant blue output.
+ The red and green LEDs are set to minimum brightness (RGB0PWM = RGB1PWM = 1'b0), effectively turning them off.

#### This configuration enables the module to deliver precise control over the RGB LED's color output, ensuring stable operation while facilitating easy testing and monitoring capabilities.

<details><summary><H2>Step 2 - Creating the PCF File</H2></summary>

### That's the PCF File

    set_io  led_blue 40
    set_io  led_green 41
    set_io  hw_clk 20
    set_io  testwire 17

<details><summary><H3>Overview of the PCF File</H3></summary>

 #### The PCF (Physical Constraints File) is used to define the physical pin assignments for the FPGA design. It specifies which physical pins on the FPGA correspond to the input and output ports defined in the Verilog code.

<details><summary><H4>Purpose</H4></summary>

#### The purpose of the PCF file is to map the logical signals defined in the Verilog module to the physical pins of the FPGA. This mapping is crucial for ensuring that the hardware behaves as intended when the design is implemented on the FPGA.


</details>

<details><summary><H4>Structure of the PCF File</H4></summary>

### The PCF file consists of pin assignments that specify the following:



<details><summary><H5>Pin Name</H5></summary>

<p>The name of the physical pin on the FPGA</p>


</details>

<details><summary><H5>Signal Name</H5></summary>

**The corresponding signal from the Verilog code.**





</details>

<details><summary><H5>Direction</H5></summary>

Indicates whether the pin is an input or output.







</details>











</details>

<details><summary><H4>Pin Assignments explained</summary>

**Each line in the PCF file corresponds to a specific pin assignment:** 


<details><summary><H5>set_io led_red 39</H5></summary>


This line assigns the `led_red` output from the Verilog module to physical pin 39 on the FPGA. The ability to control the red LED is essential for color mixing in the RGB LED. By adjusting the PWM signal for this pin, the brightness of the red light can be varied, allowing for a wide range of colors when combined with green and blue.





</details>

<details><summary><H5>set_io led_blue 40</summary>

This line assigns the `led_blue` output to pin 40. Similar to the red LED, the blue LED's brightness is controlled via PWM. This pin is crucial for producing colors that require blue light, such as purple when mixed with red or cyan when mixed with green.



</details>

<details><summary><H5>set_io led_green 41</H5></summary>

This line assigns the `led_green` output to pin 41. The green LED is vital for creating a full spectrum of colors. By varying the PWM signal on this pin, the intensity of the green light can be adjusted, enabling the creation of colors like yellow (when mixed with red) and white (when all colors are combined).


</details>

<details><summary><H5>set_io hw_clk 20</H5></summary>

This line assigns the `hw_clk input` to pin 20. Provides the clock signal for synchronization. The clock signal is fundamental for the operation of digital circuits. It ensures that all components of the Verilog module operate in sync, particularly the frequency counter that drives the timing for the RGB LED driver.


</details>

<details><summary><H5>set_io testwire 17</H5></summary>


This line assigns the `testwire output` to pin 17. This pin is important for debugging and verifying the functionality of the design. By monitoring the state of the testwire, developers can ensure that the internal oscillator and frequency counter are working correctly, which is critical for the overall performance of the RGB LED controller.



</details>






</details>

<details><summary><H4>Conclusion</H4></summary>

**These assignments ensure that the signals from the Verilog code are correctly routed to the appropriate pins on the FPGA for proper operation.**
